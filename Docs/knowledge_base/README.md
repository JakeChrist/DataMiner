# Response Knowledge Base

This workspace captures reusable insights, templates, and resolved edge cases discovered while supporting users. Keeping it current enables faster, richer answers that align with the response quality objectives.

## Folder Layout
- `entries/` – Curated knowledge assets with consistent front matter.
- `evidence_log.md` – Rolling log of primary sources and snippets gathered during research.
- `playbooks.md` – Repeatable workflows for common request types.
- `changelog.md` – Monthly summary of additions, updates, and retirements.

## Contribution Workflow
1. Draft or update the relevant file in a feature branch.
2. Request a peer review in `#response-review` (or equivalent) with highlights of new insights.
3. After approval, merge and tag the change in `changelog.md`.

## Asset Requirements
Each entry must include:
- **Title and last updated date.**
- **Summary** of the reusable takeaway (2-3 sentences).
- **Detailed guidance** with references to internal/external sources.
- **Tags** for quick filtering (e.g., `data-quality`, `roadmap`, `how-to`).
- **Related assets** linking to complementary knowledge.

## Review Cadence
- **Weekly:** Scan recent conversations to identify new insights to capture.
- **Monthly:** Knowledge base owner audits for freshness, flags outdated items, and coordinates updates.
- **Quarterly:** Cross-team share-out covering top lessons learned and changes to process.

Keeping the knowledge base healthy is essential to meeting the quality metrics defined in the improvement plan.
