# Response Quality Assurance Workflow

This workflow operationalizes the feedback loop defined in the improvement plan. Apply the steps below to every critical or externally facing response.

## 1. Draft Preparation
- Author completes the response using the standard template and research guide.
- Check that each section lists at least one reference or evidence snippet.

## 2. Peer Review
- Submit the draft in the `#response-review` channel with context (user request, due date, stakes).
- Reviewer focuses on:
  - **Completeness:** All template sections populated with sufficient depth.
  - **Accuracy:** Facts cross-checked against references and knowledge base entries.
  - **Tone:** Professional, empathetic, and user-centric language.
- Reviewer documents findings in the **QA Checklist** (see below) and assigns a confidence rating.

## 3. Revision & Approval
- Author resolves feedback, tagging reviewer when ready for re-check.
- Reviewer signs off by updating the checklist to `Approved` and posting final confidence rating.
- For urgent responses with no time for peer review, log a retroactive review request.

## 4. Publication & Logging
- Deliver the response to the user.
- Add relevant insights or reusable assets to the knowledge base (entries, evidence log, playbooks).
- Update metrics dashboard with response length, satisfaction score (if available), and follow-up count.
