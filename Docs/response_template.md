# Standard Response Template

This template ensures every substantial answer includes the information users need while maintaining a consistent, scannable structure. Each section is required unless the conversation type explicitly excludes it (for example, **References** when no sources were consulted).

1. **Summary**
   - 2-3 sentences outlining the main takeaway or recommendation.
   - Call out the overall confidence level and any blockers immediately.
2. **Detailed Analysis**
   - Provide at least three supporting points. Include comparisons, trade-offs, and quantified impacts where possible.
   - Highlight assumptions, data sources, and dependencies in-line so readers understand the rationale.
   - Use subheadings or bullet lists for clarity when covering distinct facets.
3. **Actionable Steps**
   - Deliver a short checklist the user can follow next.
   - Each step should include the expected outcome, owners (if known), and suggested timing.
4. **Risks & Mitigations**
   - Summarize the top risks or unknowns raised by the request.
   - Pair each risk with a mitigation tactic or follow-up question.
5. **References**
   - List citation-style references to documents, conversation history, or external resources relied on in the answer.
   - Use the format `[Label](link or file path) — brief note on relevance`.

> **Formatting Tips**
> - Use tables when comparing options across criteria.
> - Call out definitions or acronyms in bold on first use.
> - When adding context from prior threads, link to the relevant knowledge base entry.
