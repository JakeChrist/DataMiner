# Research Quick-Reference Guide

This cheat sheet accelerates deep-dive responses without sacrificing accuracy.

## Before You Start
- Re-read the user request and underline unknown terms or constraints.
- Check the knowledge base for related decisions, templates, or prior answers.
- Define the desired outcome (diagnosis, recommendation, comparison, tutorial).

## During Research
1. **Source Triage**
   - Prioritize internal repositories, approved datasets, and prior project notes.
   - Capture bibliographic details (title, owner, updated date) while reading.
2. **Evidence Logging**
   - Save relevant snippets with context in the evidence tracker (see `Docs/knowledge_base/evidence_log.md`).
   - Record assumptions explicitly; flag uncertain data for follow-up validation.
3. **Gap Check**
   - After gathering 3-5 strong data points, verify that you can support each section of the response template.
   - Note at least one alternative viewpoint or counterexample.

## After Drafting the Answer
- Ensure each major claim maps to a reference or evidence snippet.
- Run the **Tone & Clarity** checklist:
  - Plain language, limited jargon.
  - Uses active voice, short paragraphs, and descriptive headings.
- Share the draft in the `#response-review` channel for peer review when the request is high stakes.

## Helpful Prompts & Tools
- **Comparative Analysis Prompt:** "List decision criteria, then evaluate Option A vs Option B point-by-point."
- **Assumption Stress Test:** "What must be true for this recommendation to hold? How would we know if it failed?"
- **Risk Radar Table:** `Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Early Warning | Mitigation`.
